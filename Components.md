> People perceive PC builders as someone who is an expert at technology. Do not fear because it's actually one of the easiest things you can learn. Try to imagine stacking up a bunch of Legos together. It's as easy as that!!



# 1. Motherboard
![Motherboard](https://www.gamersnexus.net/images/media/2013/hardware/asus-maximus-vi.png)
> A [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board, logic board,[1] or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.

# 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

> A [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

# 3. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

> A [graphics processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU) is a specialized, electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.[1]

# 4. Random Access Memory (RAM)

> [Random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.[1][2] A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

# 5. Storage Devices
![Storage](https://www.computerlounge.co.nz/data/media/images/blog//SSD-vs-HDD-images.jpg)
## SSD
> A [solid-state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk,[1] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read–write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.
Reference: Solid-State Drive (Wikipedia)
## HDD
> A [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk[b] is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[2] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.

# 6. The Case
![Case](https://images10.newegg.com/BizIntell/item/11/352/11-352-084/a2_081719.jpg)
> A [computer case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case), also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, or cabinet, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse).

Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC—steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic. Other materials such as glass, wood, acrylic and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases.

> [Computer cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling) is required to remove the waste heat produced by computer components, to keep components within permissible operating temperature limits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated include integrated circuits such as central processing units (CPUs), chipsets, graphics cards, and hard disk drives.

# 8. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
![PSU](https://c1.neweggimages.com/ProductImage/17-438-159-V09.jpg)
> A [power supply unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_unit_(computer)) (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.
