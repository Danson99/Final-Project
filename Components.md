> People perceive PC builders as someone who is an expert at technology. Do not fear because it's actually one of the easiest things you can learn. Try to imagine stacking up a bunch of Legos together. It's as easy as that!!

> A [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board, logic board,[1] or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.
